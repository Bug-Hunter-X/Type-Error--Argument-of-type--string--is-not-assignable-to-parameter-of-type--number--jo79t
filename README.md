# TypeScript Type Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript: passing a string argument to a function expecting a number.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code.  `bugSolution.ts` shows how to fix it by ensuring the correct type is passed to the function.

This is a basic yet important example that highlights TypeScript's strong typing capabilities and how to prevent such errors.
